![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/Tada-TOT/Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-from-MRI-Scans-using-DL)

An end-to-end deep learning project for segmenting brain tumors from 2D MRI slices. This repository contains the full pipeline, from data analysis and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and an interactive web demo.

***

## üìã Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust AI tool to assist radiologists by automatically segmenting tumorous regions in brain MRI scans. By leveraging a **U-Net** architecture with pre-trained backbones, this project explores different configurations to achieve high accuracy, potentially leading to faster and more precise diagnoses.

### ‚ú® Key Features
* **Deep Learning Model:** Implements the **U-Net** architecture, a state-of-the-art model for biomedical image segmentation.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Trains and evaluates four model variants using **`ResNet50`** and **`EfficientNet-b0`** encoders, both with and without advanced image preprocessing techniques.
* **Advanced Preprocessing:** Includes optional image enhancement techniques like **Median Filtering** for noise reduction and **CLAHE** (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) for improved contrast.
* **Robust Training:** Utilizes a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, a **Combo Loss** function (Dice + BCE), and a learning rate scheduler for stable and effective training.
* **Comprehensive EDA:** Features a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand dataset characteristics, including tumor size, location, and intensity distributions.
* **Interactive Demo:** A simple and user-friendly web interface built with **Gradio** to allow for real-time inference on new MRI images.

## üíæ Dataset

This project uses the **[LGG MRI Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation)** available on Kaggle.

* **Content:** Contains 3,929 MRI images from 110 patients with low-grade glioma.
* **Paired Data:** Each MRI slice is paired with a corresponding binary mask, manually annotated by experts to outline the tumor region.

## üî¨ Methodology

The project follows a systematic machine learning pipeline:

1.  **Data Splitting:** A **StratifiedGroupKFold** approach is used to split the data, ensuring that all slices from a single patient remain in the same set (train/val/test) to prevent data leakage and ensure fair evaluation as well as balancing classes ratio across all splits.
2.  **Preprocessing:** Images are first de-noised with a **Median Filter** and then their contrast is enhanced using **CLAHE**. This step is a key experiment variable.
3.  **Augmentation:** A rich pipeline of augmentations (flips, rotations, elastic transformations) is applied to the training data to improve model robustness and prevent overfitting.
4.  **Model Architecture:** A **U-Net** with a pre-trained encoder (`ResNet50` or `EfficientNet-b0`) is used for transfer learning.
5.  **Training:** The model is trained in two stages: first with the encoder frozen to train the decoder, and then with the entire network unfrozen for fine-tuning. A **`ComboLoss (Dice + BCE)`** function and **`ReduceLROnPlateau`** scheduler are used.
6.  **Evaluation:** Model performance is primarily measured by the **Dice Coefficient** and **Intersection over Union (IoU)** on the unseen test set, which are standard metrics for medical segmentation.
