## 📋 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust AI tool to assist radiologists by automatically segmenting tumorous regions in brain MRI scans. By leveraging a **U-Net** architecture with pre-trained backbones, this project explores different configurations to achieve high accuracy, potentially leading to faster and more precise diagnoses.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Deep Learning Model:** Implements the **U-Net** architecture, a state-of-the-art model for biomedical image segmentation.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Trains and evaluates four model variants using **`ResNet50`** and **`EfficientNet-b0`** encoders, both with and without advanced image preprocessing techniques.
* **Advanced Preprocessing:** Includes optional image enhancement techniques like **Median Filtering** for noise reduction and **CLAHE** (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) for improved contrast.
* **Robust Training:** Utilizes a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, a composite loss function (Dice + BCE), and a learning rate scheduler for stable and effective training.
* **Comprehensive EDA:** Features a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand dataset characteristics, including tumor size, location, and intensity distributions.
* **Interactive Demo:** A simple and user-friendly web interface built with **Gradio** to allow for real-time inference on new MRI images.

## 🔬 Methodology

The project follows a systematic machine learning pipeline:

1.  **Data Splitting:** A **StratifiedGroupKFold** approach is used to split the data, ensuring that all slices from a single patient remain in the same set (train/val/test) to prevent data leakage and ensure fair evaluation as well as balancing classes ratio across all splits.
2.  **Preprocessing:** Images are first de-noised with a **Median Filter** and then their contrast is enhanced using **CLAHE**. This step is a key experiment variable.
3.  **Augmentation:** A rich pipeline of augmentations (flips, rotations, elastic transformations) is applied to the training data to improve model robustness and prevent overfitting.
4.  **Model Architecture:** A **U-Net** with a pre-trained encoder (`ResNet50` or `EfficientNet-b0`) is used for transfer learning.
5.  **Training:** The model is trained in two stages: first with the encoder frozen to train the decoder, and then with the entire network unfrozen for fine-tuning. A **`ComboLoss (Dice + BCE)`** function and **`ReduceLROnPlateau`** scheduler are used.
6.  **Evaluation:** Model performance is primarily measured by the **Dice Coefficient** and **Intersection over Union (IoU)** on the unseen test set, which are standard metrics for medical segmentation.

### Model Architecture

The U-Net architecture consists of:
- **Encoder**: Pre-trained CNN backbone (ResNet50 | EfficientNet-B0)
- **Decoder**: Symmetric expanding path with skip connections
- **Output**: Single-channel probability map with sigmoid activation

### Loss Function

We employ a composite loss function combining Dice Loss and Binary Cross-Entropy:

**Combo Loss**:

$$L_{\text{combo}} = L_{\text{dice}} + L_{\text{BCE}}$$

**Dice Loss**:

$$L_{\text{dice}} = 1 - \frac{2 \times |Y_{\text{true}} \cap Y_{\text{pred}}|}{|Y_{\text{true}}| + |Y_{\text{pred}}| + \varepsilon}$$

**Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**:

$$L_{\text{BCE}} = -\frac{1}{|Y_{\text{true}} \cup Y_{\text{pred}}|} \sum_{x \in Y_{\text{true}} \cup Y_{\text{pred}}} [y_x \log(p_x) + (1-y_x) \log(1-p_x)]$$

Where:
- $$Y_{\text{true}}$$: Ground truth binary mask
- $$Y_{\text{Pred}}$$: Predicted probability map
- $$ε = 1e-8$$: Smoothing factor to prevent division by zero
- $$y_x$$: The ground truth binary label at position/pixel x
- $$p_x$$: The predicted probability at position/pixel x 

---

### Evaluation Metrics

**Dice Coefficient (DSC)**:

$$\text{DSC} = \frac{2 \times \text{TP}}{2 \times \text{TP} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}}$$

**Intersection over Union (IoU)**:

$$\text{IoU} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}}$$

**Pixel Accuracy**:

$$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}}$$

**Precision**:

$$\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}$$

**Recall**:

$$\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}$$

Where: $$TP$$ = True Positive, $$TN$$ = True Negative, $$FP$$ = False Positive, $$FN$$ = False Negative

### Data Preprocessing

**Image Enhancement Pipeline**:
1. **Median Filtering**: `3×3` kernel for noise reduction
2. **CLAHE**: Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization
   - Clip limit: `3.0`
   - Tile grid size: `(8, 8)`
3. **Normalization**: ImageNet statistics (μ = `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]`, σ = `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`)

**Data Augmentation**:
- Horizontal/Vertical flips `(p=0.5)`
- Random rotation `(±25°)`
- Elastic transformations

### Training Strategy

**Two-Stage Fine-tuning**:
1. **Stage 1** (`5` epochs): Frozen encoder, train decoder only
   - Learning rate: `1e-4`
   - Optimizer: `AdamW`
2. **Stage 2** (`15` epochs): Full network fine-tuning
   - Learning rate: `1e-5`
   - Optimizer: `AdamW`

**Learning Rate Scheduling**:

## 🚀 How to Use

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install segmentation-models-pytorch
pip install albumentations
pip install gradio
pip install opencv-python
pip install safetensors
```

### 1. Setup
* Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Tada-TOT/Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-from-MRI-Scans-using-DL.git](https://github.com/Tada-TOT/Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-from-MRI-Scans-using-DL.git)
    ```
* Open the `SIC_Project_G9.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab**.
* Download the **[LGG MRI Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation)** from Kaggle and place it in the project directory within your Google Drive as specified in the notebook.

### 2. Running an Experiment
* The notebook is pre-configured to run all four experiments automatically. Simply run the cells from top to bottom.
* To run a single experiment, just skip `2.4 section`:
* The trained model weights for the best-performing model will be saved to your Google Drive.

### 3. Running the UI for testing
* Run `Phase 0: Environment Setup` and `Phase 3: User Interface`.
> You may need to edit `app.py` since it gets `best_model_raw_resnet50.safetensors` using hard coded path.
